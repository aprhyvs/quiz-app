Science is the systematic pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural world, driven by curiosity and observation. It uses evidence-based methods such as experimentation, measurement, and reasoning to uncover the principles and laws governing everything from the tiniest particles to vast cosmic phenomena. Through fields like biology, physics, chemistry, and astronomy, science has revolutionized our understanding of life, the universe, and everything in between. It's not just about discoveryâ€”it fuels innovation, shapes our future, and gives us tools to tackle humanityâ€™s biggest challenges.
